A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?


## Real-world stats


| Metric | Reported |
|--------|--------|
| **Largest transfer** | 452 GB |
| **Fastest large transfer** | 54 GB @ 123 MB/s (~1 Gbps) |
| **High-speed bulk transfer** | 328 GB @ 93 MB/s |
| **Peak speed measured** | 125 MB/s (1 Gbps) |

*Transfer throughput depends on your device, network, and connection path.*



## Features

- **Send anywhere** – Works seamlessly on local networks or across continents.
- [**Transfer anything**](https://www.iroh.computer/proto/iroh-blobs) – Send files or directories of any size or any format, verified with BLAKE3-based integrity checks.
- **No accounts or personal info** – Transfer files without sign-ups or exposing personal info.
- **Peer-to-peer direct transfer** – Send files straight between devices, with no cloud storage in between.
- **Authentication** - Tickets contains cryptographic identity info for authentication.
- **End-to-end encryption** – Always-on protection with QUIC + TLS 1.3 for forward and backward secrecy.
- **Resumable transfers** – Interrupted downloads automatically resume where they left off.
- **Broadcast** - Share same file/folder with any number of peers.
- **Preview** - View and verify before downloading
- **Fast & reliable** – Capable of saturating multi-gigabit connections for lightning-fast transfers.
- [**NAT traversal via QUIC**](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/faq#does-iroh-use-relay-servers) – Secure, low-latency connections using QUIC hole punching with encrypted relay fallback.
- **CLI integration** – Interoperable with the [Sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme).
- **Free & open source** – No upload costs, no size limits, and fully community-driven.
- **Coming Soon** – iOS and Web versions

## How it works 

1. Drop your file or folder - AltSendme creates a one-time share code (called a "ticket").
2.  Share the ticket via chat, email, or text.
3. Your friend pastes the ticket in their app, and the transfer begins.


## Under the hood ⚙️🛠️

AltSendme uses [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer) under the hood to enable peer-to-peer file transfer. It is a modern modular alternative to technologies like WebRTC and libp2p.

### Important concepts 

- *Blobs*
- *Tickets*
- *Peer Discovery*, *Hole-punching* & *NAT traversal*
- *QUIC* & *End-to-end encryption*
- *Relays*


### 1. Blobs

Content-addressed blob storage and transfer. `iroh-blobs` implements request/response and streaming transfers of arbitrary-sized byte blobs, using BLAKE3-verified streams and content-addressed links.

- Blob: an opaque sequence of bytes (no embedded metadata).
- Link: a 32-byte BLAKE3 hash that identifies a blob.
- HashSeq: a blob that contains a sequence of links (useful for chunking/trees).
- Provider / Requester: provider serves data; requester fetches it. An endpoint can be both.

### 2. Tickets

Tickets are a way to share dialing information between iroh endpoints. They're a single token that contains everything needed to connect to another endpoint, or to fetch a blob in this case. Contains Ed25519 NodeIds: Your device's cryptographic identity for authentication.They're also very powerful. It's worth pointing out this setup is considerably better than full peer-2-peer systems, which broadcast your IP to peers. Instead in iroh, tickets are used to form a "cozy network" between peers you explicitly want to connect with. It's possible to go "full p2p" & configure your app to broadcast dialing details, but tickets represent a better middle-ground default.


### 3. Peer Discovery, NAT Traversal & Hole Punching

Peers register with an open-source public relay servers at startup to help traverse firewalls and NATs, enabling connection setup. Once connected, Iroh uses QUIC hole punching to try and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection, bypassing the relay. If direct connection is possible, communication happens directly between peers with end-to-end encryption; otherwise, the relay operates only temporarily as a fallback. This enables smooth reliable connections between peers within local-network and across the internet.

###  4. QUIC & Encryption

QUIC is a modern transport protocol built on UDP, designed to reduce latency and improve web performance over TCP. Developed originally by Google and now standardized by the IETF as HTTP/3's foundation, it integrates TLS 1.3 encryption directly into the protocol.

QUIC allows following super-powers:
* encryption & authentication
* stream multiplexing
    * no head-of-line blocking issues
    * stream priorities
    * one shared congestion controller
* an encrypted, unreliable datagram transport
* zero round trip time connection establishment if you've connected to another endpoint before


### 5. Relays

AltSendme uses open-source public relay servers to support establishing direct connections, to speed up initial connection times, and to provide a fallback should direct connections between two endpoints fail or be impossible otherwise. All connections are end-to-end encrypted. The relay is “just another UDP socket” for sending encrypted packets around. [Read more.](https://docs.iroh.computer/about/faq)

### Self-hosting relays

For how to run your own iroh relay, configure AltSendme to use it, and how mixed public/self-hosted setups behave, see [`deploy/relay/README.md`](deploy/relay/README.md#using-self-hosted-relays-with-altsendme).
