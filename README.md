A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?


## Real-world stats

<div align="center">

| Metric | Reported |
|--------|--------|
| **Largest transfer** | 452 GB |
| **Fastest large transfer** | 54 GB @ 123 MB/s (~1 Gbps) |
| **High-speed bulk transfer** | 328 GB @ 93 MB/s |
| **Peak speed measured** | 125 MB/s (1 Gbps) |

*Transfer throughput depends on your device, network, and connection path.*

## How it works 

1. Drop your file or folder - AltSendme creates a one-time share code (called a "ticket").
2.  Share the ticket via chat, email, or text.
3. Your friend pastes the ticket in their app, and the transfer begins.


## Under the hood ⚙️🛠️

AltSendme uses [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer) under the hood to enable peer-to-peer file transfer. It is a modern modular alternative to technologies like WebRTC and libp2p.

### Important concepts 

- *Blobs*
- *Tickets*
- *Peer Discovery*, *Hole-punching* & *NAT traversal*
- *QUIC* & *End-to-end encryption*
- *Relays*


### 1. Blobs

Content-addressed blob storage and transfer. `iroh-blobs` implements request/response and streaming transfers of arbitrary-sized byte blobs, using BLAKE3-verified streams and content-addressed links.

- Blob: an opaque sequence of bytes (no embedded metadata).
- Link: a 32-byte BLAKE3 hash that identifies a blob.
- HashSeq: a blob that contains a sequence of links (useful for chunking/trees).
- Provider / Requester: provider serves data; requester fetches it. An endpoint can be both.

### 2. Tickets

Tickets are a way to share dialing information between iroh endpoints. They're a single token that contains everything needed to connect to another endpoint, or to fetch a blob in this case. Contains Ed25519 NodeIds: Your device's cryptographic identity for authentication.They're also very powerful. It's worth pointing out this setup is considerably better than full peer-2-peer systems, which broadcast your IP to peers. Instead in iroh, tickets are used to form a "cozy network" between peers you explicitly want to connect with. It's possible to go "full p2p" & configure your app to broadcast dialing details, but tickets represent a better middle-ground default.


### 3. Peer Discovery, NAT Traversal & Hole Punching

Peers register with an open-source public relay servers at startup to help traverse firewalls and NATs, enabling connection setup. Once connected, Iroh uses QUIC hole punching to try and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection, bypassing the relay. If direct connection is possible, communication happens directly between peers with end-to-end encryption; otherwise, the relay operates only temporarily as a fallback. This enables smooth reliable connections between peers within local-network and across the internet.

###  4. QUIC & Encryption

QUIC is a modern transport protocol built on UDP, designed to reduce latency and improve web performance over TCP. Developed originally by Google and now standardized by the IETF as HTTP/3's foundation, it integrates TLS 1.3 encryption directly into the protocol.

QUIC allows following super-powers:
* encryption & authentication
* stream multiplexing
    * no head-of-line blocking issues
    * stream priorities
    * one shared congestion controller
* an encrypted, unreliable datagram transport
* zero round trip time connection establishment if you've connected to another endpoint before


### 5. Relays

AltSendme uses open-source public relay servers to support establishing direct connections, to speed up initial connection times, and to provide a fallback should direct connections between two endpoints fail or be impossible otherwise. All connections are end-to-end encrypted. The relay is “just another UDP socket” for sending encrypted packets around. [Read more.](https://docs.iroh.computer/about/faq)

### Self-hosting relays

You can run your own iroh relay and point AltSendme at it instead of the public infrastructure:

1. Deploy a relay using the assets in [`deploy/relay/`](deploy/relay/README.md) (Docker Compose on a VPS or Fly.io).
2. In the app, open **Settings → Network** and choose **Custom self-hosted**.
3. Add your relay URL(s) and optional auth token if you enabled `access.shared_token` on the server.
4. Use **Test connection** to verify registration.

For a fully private setup, configure the same relay URLs on both sender and receiver devices.

### What if only one person uses a self-hosted relay?

Transfers can still work when one side uses custom relays and the other uses the default public relays. Here's the simple version:

**Your relay setting controls where *your* device registers.** When you share a file, the ticket includes *your* relay URL. The other person connects using that ticket — they don't need to match your settings.

| Who shares | Sender uses | Receiver uses | Usually works? |
|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Alice | Custom (open relay) | Public relays | Yes — receiver reaches Alice via the relay URL in the ticket |
| Alice | Custom (auth token required) | Public relays, no token | Often no — receiver can't authenticate to Alice's private relay |
| Alice | Custom (auth token required) | Same relay + same token | Yes |
| Either side | Any | Any, same LAN or good NAT | Yes — direct peer-to-peer may skip relays entirely |

**Direction matters for privacy, not just connectivity:**

- **You share, they use public relays:** If a relay is needed, traffic may go through *your* relay. They still use public relays for their own device.
- **They share, you use a self-hosted relay:** If a relay is needed, traffic may go through *their* public relay — yours isn't used for that path.

So mixed setups are fine for getting files across, but they're **not fully private** unless both people use the same self-hosted relay(s) (or connect directly without relay fallback).

**Quick rules of thumb:**

- **Just want it to work?** An open self-hosted relay (no auth token) is enough; the other person can keep default public relays.
- **Want a private relay?** Both people need your relay URL **and** the auth token in **Settings → Network**.
- **Want zero public relay use?** Both people must set **Custom self-hosted** to the same relay(s).
- **Want no relays at all?** Both people set **Disabled** — only works when a direct connection is possible (e.g. same network).

   adb install -r src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/debug/app-universal-debug.apk
   ```

## Testing Locally

Install [Sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) tool and you can share files within same device to test the whole transfer process. Files don't leave your device it works like a copy operation.
