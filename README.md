A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?



## Features

- **Send anywhere, from anything** - Desktop, Android, terminal, or browser - start on one platform, receive on any other.
- **Transfer anything, any size** - Files or entire directories, verified end-to-end with BLAKE3 integrity checks.
- **Fast enough to matter** – Saturates multi-gigabit connections for lightning-fast transfers.
- **Private by default** - No accounts, no sign-ups, no tracking, no ads. 
- **Direct device-to-device transfer** - Files move directly between your devices, avoiding corporate cloud storage where data is the price.
- **End-to-end encryption, always on** - Every transfer uses QUIC with TLS 1.3; relays only see encrypted traffic even if they are involved.
- **Cryptographic authentication** - Every ticket verifies you're connected to the intended sender before any files transfer.
- **Resumable & broadcastable** - Interrupted transfers resume automatically; share the same file with any number of peers at once.
- **Preview before you commit** - See what you're receiving before you download it.
- **Featherlight** - Tiny installs, minimal web footprint.
- **Free & open source** - No upload costs, no size limits, community-driven.


## Real-world stats


| Metric | Reported |
|--------|--------|
| **Largest transfer** | 452 GB |
| **Fastest large transfer** | 54 GB @ 123 MB/s (~1 Gbps) |
| **High-speed bulk transfer** | 328 GB @ 93 MB/s |
| **Peak speed measured** | 125 MB/s (1 Gbps) |

*Transfer throughput depends on your device, network, and connection path.*

We're looking for Partners to join our mission! Partner with us and support while we push the boundaries of peer-to-peer file transfer.

## How it works 

1. Drop your file or folder - AltSendme creates a one-time share code (called a "ticket").
2.  Share the ticket via chat, email, or text.
3. Your friend pastes the ticket in their app, and the transfer begins.


## Under the hood 

AltSendme uses [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer) under the hood to enable peer-to-peer file transfer. It is a modern modular alternative to technologies like WebRTC and libp2p.

### Important concepts 

- *Blobs*
- *Tickets*
- *Peer Discovery*, *Hole-punching* & *NAT traversal*
- *QUIC* & *End-to-end encryption*
- *Relays*


### 1. Blobs

Content-addressed blob storage and transfer. `iroh-blobs` implements request/response and streaming transfers of arbitrary-sized byte blobs, using BLAKE3-verified streams and content-addressed links.

- Blob: an opaque sequence of bytes (no embedded metadata).
- Link: a 32-byte BLAKE3 hash that identifies a blob.
- HashSeq: a blob that contains a sequence of links (useful for chunking/trees).
- Provider / Requester: provider serves data; requester fetches it. An endpoint can be both.

### 2. Tickets

Tickets are a way to share dialing information between iroh endpoints. They're a single token that contains everything needed to connect to another endpoint, or to fetch a blob in this case. Contains Ed25519 NodeIds: Your device's cryptographic identity for authentication.They're also very powerful. It's worth pointing out this setup is considerably better than full peer-2-peer systems, which broadcast your IP to peers. Instead in iroh, tickets are used to form a "cozy network" between peers you explicitly want to connect with. It's possible to go "full p2p" & configure your app to broadcast dialing details, but tickets represent a better middle-ground default.


### 3. Peer Discovery, NAT Traversal & Hole Punching

Peers register with an open-source public relay servers at startup to help traverse firewalls and NATs, enabling connection setup. Once connected, Iroh uses QUIC hole punching to try and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection, bypassing the relay. If direct connection is possible, communication happens directly between peers with end-to-end encryption; otherwise, the relay operates only temporarily as a fallback. This enables smooth reliable connections between peers within local-network and across the internet.

###  4. QUIC & Encryption

QUIC is a modern transport protocol built on UDP, designed to reduce latency and improve web performance over TCP. Developed originally by Google and now standardized by the IETF as HTTP/3's foundation, it integrates TLS 1.3 encryption directly into the protocol.

QUIC allows following super-powers:
* encryption & authentication
* stream multiplexing
    * no head-of-line blocking issues
    * stream priorities
    * one shared congestion controller
* an encrypted, unreliable datagram transport
* zero round trip time connection establishment if you've connected to another endpoint before


### 5. Relays

AltSendme uses open-source public relay servers to support establishing direct connections, to speed up initial connection times, and to provide a fallback should direct connections between two endpoints fail or be impossible otherwise. All connections are end-to-end encrypted. The relay is “just another UDP socket” for sending encrypted packets around. [Read more.](https://docs.iroh.computer/about/faq)

### Self-hosting relays

For how to run your own iroh relay, configure AltSendme to use it, and how mixed public/self-hosted setups behave, see [`deploy/relay/README.md`](deploy/relay/README.md#using-self-hosted-relays-with-altsendme).
