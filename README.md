A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?



## Features

- **Send anywhere, from anything** - Desktop, Android, terminal, or browser - start on one platform, receive on any other.
- **Transfer anything, any size** - Files or entire directories, verified end-to-end with BLAKE3 integrity checks.
- **Fast enough to matter** - Saturates multi-gigabit connections for lightning-fast transfers.
- **Private by default** - No accounts, no sign-ups, no tracking, no ads. 
- **Direct device-to-device transfer** - Files move directly between your devices, avoiding corporate cloud storage where data is the price.
- **End-to-end encryption, always on** - Every transfer uses QUIC with TLS 1.3; relays only see encrypted traffic even if they are involved.
- **Cryptographic authentication** - Every ticket verifies you're connected to the intended sender before any files transfer.
- **Resumable & broadcastable** - Interrupted transfers resume automatically; share the same file with any number of peers at once.
- **Preview before you download** - See what you're receiving before you download it.
- **Paired devices** - Pair computers and Android phones once in **Settings → Devices**, then send files without copying tickets each time.
- **Featherlight** - Tiny installs, minimal web footprint.
- **Free & open source** - No upload costs, no size limits, community-driven.


## Real-world stats


| Metric | Reported |
|--------|--------|
| **Largest transfer** | 452 GB |
| **Fastest large transfer** | 54 GB @ 123 MB/s (~1 Gbps) |
| **High-speed bulk transfer** | 328 GB @ 93 MB/s |
| **Peak speed measured** | 125 MB/s (1 Gbps) |

*Transfer throughput depends on your device, network, and connection path.*

## How it works 

1. Drop your file or folder - AltSendme creates a one-time share code (called a "ticket").
2. Share the ticket via chat, email, or text, **or** send directly to a paired device (desktop / Android).
3. Your friend pastes the ticket in their app (or accepts a paired-device invite), and the transfer begins.

### Paired devices

On macOS, Windows, Linux, and Android you can pair devices in **Settings → Devices** using a pairing code. After pairing:

- Senders can tap **Send** next to a paired device while sharing: no manual ticket copy.
- Receivers get an in-app prompt when a paired sender invites them (app must be open).
- Manual tickets and the [sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) still work exactly as before.

## Under the hood

AltSendme is built on [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer), a modern peer-to-peer networking stack that simplifies direct device-to-device communication. In practice, that means devices talk over encrypted QUIC, files move with content-addressed blobs, and relays help when a direct path isn’t available.

### The building blocks

| Piece | What it does here |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Blobs** (`iroh-blobs`) | Store and stream file data; every chunk is verified with BLAKE3 |
| **Tickets** | One string that tells a peer *who* to dial and *what* to fetch |
| **Endpoints** | Each device’s Iroh identity (Ed25519 key → endpoint id) |
| **QUIC + TLS 1.3** | Encrypted transport; multiplexing without head-of-line blocking |
| **Relays + hole punching** | Bootstrap connections across NATs; prefer direct, fall back to relay |
| **Control protocol** (pairing) | Long-lived channel to remember devices and deliver share invites |

### Blobs

Files aren’t uploaded to a server. They’re published as **blobs**: opaque byte sequences addressed by a BLAKE3 hash.

- A **link** is that 32-byte hash: if the hash matches, the content matches.
- Folders and large files use a **HashSeq** (a blob that points at other blobs).
- The sender is the **provider**; the receiver is the **requester**. Either side can do both.

### Tickets

A share **ticket** is a single token that packs:

1. The sender’s endpoint id (so you know you’re talking to the right device)
2. Enough address / relay info to dial them
3. The blob hash to download

You only connect to people you share a ticket with: no broadcasting your IP to strangers. That’s the default “cozy network” model Iroh encourages, vs. flooding discovery to the whole swarm.

### Connecting across networks

When two devices need to meet:

1. Each registers with a public (or self-hosted) **relay** so peers can find a path through firewalls and NATs.
2. Iroh tries **QUIC hole punching** to upgrade to a direct peer-to-peer link.
3. If a direct path works, traffic goes device-to-device. If not, the relay stays in the path as a fallback UDP hop.

Either way, the payload is end-to-end encrypted. Relays see ciphertext, not your files. [More on Iroh relays →](https://docs.iroh.computer/about/faq)

### QUIC & encryption

QUIC (UDP-based, same foundation as HTTP/3) brings TLS 1.3 into the transport. For AltSendme that buys encryption and authentication, multiple streams with shared congestion control, and fast reconnects when you’ve talked to a peer before.

### Paired devices

Pairing doesn’t replace tickets; it delivers them for you.

1. Devices exchange a short **pairing code** (the host’s endpoint id) over a dedicated control ALPN (`altsendme/control/1`).
2. Each side proves identity by signing connection-bound keying material with its device secret, then remembers the peer locally.
3. A persistent control connection keeps presence (online/offline).
4. When you share, AltSendme still creates a normal one-time blob ticket; choosing a paired device ships that ticket as an in-app **invite** instead of making you copy-paste it.

Manual tickets and the [sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) keep working exactly as before.

### Self-hosting relays

For how to run your own iroh relay, configure AltSendme to use it, and how mixed public/self-hosted setups behave, see [`deploy/relay/README.md`](deploy/relay/README.md#using-self-hosted-relays-with-altsendme).
